This project is intended to be boilerplate for future projects.

It uses
1. Semantic Ui for a Ui framework
1. React as a Frontend framework
1. Django as a backend
1. Django Rest Auth for authentication
1. PostgreSQL as a development db
1. Docker Compose to orchestrate the development framework.

You should replace the secrets in the docker-compose override.

Then `docker-compose build && docker-compose up` should have you covered.
